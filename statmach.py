class State:
    """
    A state with an optional ``ident``, optional ``value``, and with actions.
    Actions are an event entry in the ``actions`` dictionary of a tuple of new state and new value.
    ``Machine``'s ``fire`` method changes the machine state to the new state and returns the new value.

    A Mearly Machine has the new value associated with each action,
    whereas a Moore Machine has the new value associated with each state.
    Some state machines are easier to code with states having values whilst others are easier to code with
    actions having values, hence ``State`` supports both types of state machine.

    For a Moore Machine the ``action`` property (not ``actions`` dictionary - note 's') is a convenient way of
    returning the action tuple of new state (``self``) and new value (``self.value``).
